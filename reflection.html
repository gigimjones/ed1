	<h1> Matchbox Replica Reflection</h1>
		<p> This reflection is all about my first 3D printed project where I had to replicate a matchbox car.</p>
	<h2> Guidelines:</h2>
		<p>	The guidelines for this project were: Design a car as an intersection of three forms, design the car in a 1:1 ratio, 			have a size accuracy of Â±1%, export the design as an stl file, orient a model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize 			support material, export the file as a code, and share the final file out as an embedded STL file on a HTML webpage.
		</p>
	<h2> Process:</h2>
		<p> I first started by choosing a car to replicate. Once I picked my car, I then began to take measurements using calipers. 			I measured the length, width, and height of my car. Next, I began to draw. I used graphing paper to make the drawing 			as realistic as possible. I drew views of the front, side, and top as well as a three demential view so that I could 			see my measurements more easily. Next, I began the process of putting my design into OnShape following along with a 			series of tutorial videos. I started with the side view and then continued onto the front and top views so that all 			of the drawings were in 3D form in OnShape. Next, I used the draw feature to draw the outline of the car. I then 			deleted my drawing so that the outline was all that was left and my drawing was transformed into a 3 dimensional 			car. I then imported this design into Ultimaker and began printing. The printing took about two hours. Once my car 			was printed, I used tweezers and a file to get rid of the supports and make my car's shape more clear. Finally, I 			photographed my final design.
		</p>
	<h2> Setbacks and Solutions:</h2>
		<p>I struggled with my final design file in Ultimaker. I didn't change my measurements in OnShape so the file did not convert. I fixed this by going back and importing my file again. I also had help from my classmates and teachers. </p>
